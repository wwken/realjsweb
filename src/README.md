# Examples for @vis.gl/react-google-maps

All of our examples are fully self-contained and can be run as independent
applications, even when the entire directory is copied elsewhere. Just run
`npm install` and `npm start` in any example directory to start it.

During development of the library, the examples can also be started using
`npm run start-local`, which will run the example with the checked-out
source of the library instead of the package installed via npm.

All examples also contain a link to a CodeSandbox environment where the
example can be played with right away.

When browsing the examples on GitHub, you can also just replace `github.com`
with `githubbox.com` in your url while you're in an example directory to
open it in a codesandbox environment.

More information about how to write examples [can be found in our
documentation][writing-examples].
